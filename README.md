# News Website Front End
NC News is a project I worked on during the Northcoders Bootcamp. This is the first build I had done of this size and was created over the span of 5 days. For the Frontend I used React to **Build** and Netlify to **Host**, and for the Backend I used Express and PostgreSQL to **Build** and ElephantSQL and Render to **Host**.
